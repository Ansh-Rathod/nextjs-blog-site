Here I am going to discuss five Flutter components. If you want to be an expert in Flutter, knowledge about Packages is a must. Here I will discuss 5 important packages. With the use of these, you can build interactive applications according to the app features.
<br/>
<br/>

## Cached network image

<br/>

[Cached_network_image | pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image)

<br/>

A flutter library to show images from the internet and keep them in the cache directory.
**Why do we need to cache images in our flutter app??**

The main benefit of caching an image service is to improve its performance. The cached image service can display an image very fast because ArcGIS Server does not have to generate the image dynamically.

**How to use This package?**

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):

<br/>
<br/>

<script type="text/javascript"  src="https://gist.github.com/anshrathod-blog/31491325f9c1f6928a6ffa2cf3c8bfb5.js"></script>

<br/>

## url_launcher

<br/>

[url_launcher | pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/url_launcher)
<br/>
<br/>

Does your app need a way to send users to external through the URLs?, Either to send an email or to a web page or even sometimes to a phone number?. The URL package is for you. For example, opening a web page on a button press is as easy as calling a single method. You can also use the url_launcher with telephone numbers. This will start the phoneâ€™s dialer app, or you can initiate text messages or even emails. If there are apps installed with special URL handlers, such as Youtube, your app can direct into those apps. Make sure to call canLaunch to check if the device can open the URL. Otherwise, An error will return.
<br/>
<br/>

<script type="text/javascript"  src="https://gist.github.com/anshrathod-blog/cd81900def5e4cc50b2d0c77fca54c76.js"></script>

<br/>

## google_fonts

<br/>

[google_fonts | pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts)
<br/>
<br/>

The google_fonts package for Flutter allows you to easily use any of the 977 fonts (and their variants) from [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com) in your Flutter app.
with this package, you do not need to store the .ttf of .otf file in your assets folder and mapped in the pubspec,yaml file.

**How to use?**
<br/>
<br/>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/anshrathod-blog/135eb983ecd585e78c636de1541b1706.js"></script>

<br/>

## http

<br/>

[http | pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/http)

<br/>

Fetching data from the internet is necessary for most apps. Luckily, Dart and Flutter provide tools, such as the http package, for this type of work.
<br/>
